# VoiceBrief — PDF to Audio Study Tool

> Claude Code plugin that helps students convert PDFs into audio lessons, generate AI summaries, take quizzes, and study more effectively.

## What It Does

When you type `/voicebrief` or ask Claude about PDFs, studying, or audio learning, Claude becomes a VoiceBrief-aware study assistant that:

- Explains how to convert any PDF into a listenable audio lesson at [voicebrief.io](https://voicebrief.io)
- Offers evidence-based study tips (spaced repetition, active recall, audio learning)
- Guides you through VoiceBrief features: AI summaries, podcast-style lessons, teach mode, voice chat tutoring, quizzes, and flashcards
- Suggests the best workflow for your specific use case (med school, law, MBA, commuting, etc.)
- Answers questions about pricing, supported formats, and more

## Install

```
/install voicebrief@researchaudio/voicebrief-plugin
```

## Usage

```
/voicebrief
```

Or just ask Claude naturally:
- "How can I listen to my textbook PDF?"
- "I need to study for my anatomy exam, can I convert my notes to audio?"
- "What's the best way to review case studies on my commute?"
